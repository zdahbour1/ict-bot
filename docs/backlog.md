## CRITICAL — Architecture

### ARCH-001: Database is the Single Source of Truth
**Principle**: The PostgreSQL database is the ONLY source of truth for all system state. No process should rely on its in-memory cache for state decisions. Every component reads from the DB. Accuracy is more important than speed — PostgreSQL has its own caching layer.

**Current violations**:
1. `exit_manager.open_trades` (in-memory list) acts as parallel source of truth — trades can exist in memory but not DB, or vice versa
2. `open_trades.json` file is a stale backup of the in-memory list
3. Reconciliation has to sync two sources (IB + DB) but also a third (in-memory list)
4. When bot restarts, it loads from `open_trades.json`, not from DB
5. `add_trade()` writes to in-memory list first, then DB — if DB write fails, state diverges

**Required changes**:
- Exit manager reads open trades from DB every cycle (5s) — no in-memory list as source of truth
- `add_trade()` writes to DB FIRST. If DB write fails, trade is NOT tracked (fail-safe).
- Remove `open_trades.json` entirely — DB is the persistence layer
- On startup, rebuild state from DB, not from JSON file
- All trade state decisions (is this trade open? what's the qty?) query the DB
- Dashboard already reads from DB (correct pattern)

Status: **Implemented** — exit_manager reads from DB, no JSON, DB-first add_trade

### ARCH-002: Row-Level Locking for Trade State Transitions
**Principle**: When changing the state of any trade (open→closed, updating price, rolling), the process MUST use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (row-level locking) to prevent race conditions between parallel components.

Status: **Implemented** — close_trade uses SELECT FOR UPDATE NOWAIT, update_trade_price uses GREATEST

### ARCH-005: Single Close Authority + Graceful Already-Closed Handling
**Principle**: Only ONE code path can close trades — `_atomic_close()` in exit_manager. No other thread, module, or function sends sell orders. All close requests funnel through this single point.

Status: **Implemented and enforced**

### ARCH-006: Single Open Authority — one function opens all trades
**Principle**: Same as ARCH-005 (single close), but for opening trades. Only ONE function creates trade records in the DB. All paths use it — `exit_manager.add_trade()`.

Status: **Implemented** — add_trade() checks DB for existing open trade on same ticker before INSERT

### ARCH-003: Refactor into Clean, Small, Reusable Components
**Principle**: Each module has a single responsibility, is independently testable, and communicates only through the DB. No module should be >200 lines. No duplicated logic.

Status: **Implemented (ib_client split)** — shipped in commit `6d7c32f` (merged from `feature/arch-003-ib-client-split`). `broker/ib_client.py` is now a thin facade over `ib_orders.py`, `ib_market_data.py`, `ib_positions.py`, `ib_contracts.py`. Further decomposition of `exit_manager` / `trade_entry_manager` is a fresh-eyes pass but the hotspots from this item are done.

### ARCH-004: Automated Regression Test Suite
**Principle**: Every bug fix and enhancement must have a corresponding test. No code change ships without passing the full regression suite.

Status: **Implemented** — 26 unit test files (~4.5k LOC) under `tests/unit/`; `test_results` + `test_runs` tables persist runs; dashboard Tests tab ("Run Unit" / "Run Concurrency" / "Run Integration") drives the suite. CLAUDE.md mandates running the suite before declaring any task done.

## Multi-Strategy Foundation — SHIPPED (2026-04-22)

### ENH-030: Multi-strategy v2 architecture ✅
Spec: `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` (design doc approved 2026-04-22, P&L-aggregation note added for open trades).
Status: **All 6 phases shipped.** Bot running live with 4 active strategies (ICT + ORB + VWAP + delta-neutral).

Implementation commit map:
- **Phase 2a** — DB migration (`6e7ed0a`): slim `trades` envelope + `trade_legs` child table, `trades_pre_legs` frozen snapshot, views `v_trades_with_first_leg` + `v_trades_aggregate_pnl`, retired `ACTIVE_STRATEGY` singleton setting.
- **Phase 2b** — ORM + writer refactor (`3585385`): `Trade` slimmed, new `TradeLeg` model, `insert_trade` writes both tables in one tx.
- **Phase 2c-1** — strategy/ layer (`6cec13d`, `de4757e`): inline SQL in `strategy/reconciliation.py` retargeted to `trade_legs`.
- **Phase 2c-2** — dashboard (`2571c6c`, `2247842`, `515c6d5`): routes + analytics views.
- **Phase 2c-3** — broker orphan cleanup (`1fa664f`).
- **Phase 3** — Settings UI scoping (`0a1f701`, `f847140`) + Tickers UI scoping (`e22a9d8`, `1873059`).
- **Phase 4** — Scanner plugin dispatch (`8200dff`, `ac37e43`, `4eb5dc9`, `b7a4c39`): per-strategy per-ticker threads, plugin `class_path` loading, ICT fast-path preserved.
- **Phase 5** — Thread-owned close (`57ad72c`, `7e5a947`, `fe3900e`, `c522492`): `trades.ib_client_id` stamped at entry, `cancel_order_by_id(preferred_client_id=...)` prefers owner.
- **Phase 6a** — Multi-leg execution (`b812307`, `3be323a`, `4386409`, `230811b`, `35dae3b`): `LegSpec`, `place_multi_leg_order`, `insert_multi_leg_trade`, delta-neutral plugin skeleton.
- **Phase 6b** — Close-across-legs (`65dfc96`): `_execute_multi_leg_exit` iterates each leg with the correct closing order (LONG CALL → sell_call, SHORT CALL → buy_call, etc.).

Follow-up fixes shipped same day:
- Pool-aware `get_all_working_orders` (`23fd21e`) — stopped spurious bracket restoration.
- Strategy prefix on `client_trade_id` (`f9c70da`) — refs like `ict-SPY-260422-01`.
- Per-strategy lock in `get_open_trades_from_db` (`020305a`) — unblocks ORB/VWAP from ICT's ticker slots.
- `thread_status` CHECK constraint widened (`75d3639`).
- `v_trades_aggregate_pnl` now marks open trades via `current_price` (migration 009).

### ARCH-007: Stable clientId pool routing ✅ (Phase 5)
Spec: `docs/ib_db_correlation.md` §11.
Status: **Shipped.** `trades.ib_client_id` populated at entry; close flow prefers that pool slot; permId fan-out retained as fallback.

### ENH-031: Multi-leg trade model ✅ (Phase 6a + 6b)
Spec: `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` §2, §6.
Status: **Shipped.** `trade_legs` table, `LegSpec` dataclass, `place_multi_leg_order`, `_execute_multi_leg_exit`.

### ENH-032: Settings + Tickers UI scoped per strategy ✅ (Phase 3)
Spec: `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` §5.
Status: **Shipped.** Strategy dropdown on both Settings and Tickers tabs, inherited-vs-override pills, reset-to-global.

### ENH-033: Auto-restart on strategy activation — NOT STARTED
Status: **Deferred polish item.** Today: enabling/disabling a strategy in the UI requires a full bot restart for the scanner spawn loop to pick up the change. Low priority — restart is ~15s.

---

## Multi-Strategy — Deferred / Open Items

Tracked here so they don't fall through the cracks. Work when appropriate.

### ENH-034: Live FOP trading path ✅ SHIPPED (2026-04-22)
Spec: `docs/fop_live_trading_design.md`.
Status: **Shipped** in commits `c49585f` (selector + 26 tests) + `a2fa962` (broker methods + option_selector routing).
Implementation:
- `strategy/fop_selector.py` — liquidity-aware contract picker (quarterly > monthly > weekly preference, hard-rejects on OI/volume/spread).
- `broker/ib_orders.py::place_bracket_order_fop` — places bracket on FuturesOption contract.
- `broker/ib_orders.py::fop_chain` / `fop_quote` — IB probes the selector injects.
- `strategy/option_selector.py` — FOP branch at top of `select_and_enter` / `select_and_enter_put`, sec_type lookup from `tickers` table.
- Config knobs: `FOP_MAX_DTE`, `FOP_MIN_OPEN_INTEREST`, `FOP_MIN_VOLUME`, `FOP_MAX_SPREAD_PCT`, `FOP_EXPIRY_PREF`.
Activation: takes effect on next bot restart + requires adding a ticker row with `sec_type='FOP'` on an enabled strategy (via Tickers tab). Until then behavior unchanged.
Remaining FOP follow-ups (not blocking live use):
- FOP roll logic (currently picks OCC-style symbol; FOP roll needs FuturesOption-aware roll path).
- `USE_BRACKET_ORDERS=False` path unsupported for FOP (aborts with warning — bracket is production default).

### ENH-035: Production IV detection for DeltaNeutralStrategy.detect()
Spec: `docs/delta_neutral_strategy.md` (existing) + v2 doc §8 open questions.
Today: `strategy/delta_neutral_strategy.py` uses a rolling-stddev proxy for IV elevation — rudimentary and doesn't reliably trigger. Production version should consume IB greeks or an external IV feed (e.g. underlying's IV30, VIX structure, or the contract's `modelGreeks.impliedVol` from `reqMktData`).

### ENH-036: Stock-leg close support in multi-leg exit ✅ SHIPPED (2026-04-22)
Status: **Shipped** in commit `82848ae`.
`broker/ib_orders.py::sell_stock` / `buy_stock` helpers added. `_close_action_for_leg` now maps STK LONG → sell_stock, STK SHORT → buy_stock. Delta-neutral trades with a stock hedge now close the hedge alongside the options.

### ENH-037: Cross-strategy exposure caps
Spec: `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` §8 open question 7.
Today: no global limit on concurrent strategies' open positions. Possible to have ICT + ORB + VWAP + delta-neutral all long SPY at once → concentrated risk. Proposed: configurable net-delta or gross-notional cap per underlying, checked in `TradeEntryManager.can_enter()`.

### ENH-038: Delta-neutral backtest support ✅ SHIPPED
Status:
- **Part 1** — migration 011 (`backtest_trade_legs` + `backtest_trades.n_legs`), `record_multi_leg_trade` writer, engine router on `trade["_legs"]`. Shipped in `03fe86e`.
- **Part 2** — `backtest_engine/multi_leg_sim.py` (BS + Black-76 per-leg pricing, entry/exit state, synth_price collapse to scalar for evaluate_exit). `_simulate_ticker` now takes the multi-leg branch when `strategy.place_legs()` returns legs. Shipped in `5bbe120`.
- **Tests** — 4 in `test_backtest_multi_leg.py` + 15 in `test_backtest_multi_leg_sim.py` (helpers + DeltaNeutral end-to-end with stubbed fetch/levels/exit).

`python run_backtest_engine.py --strategy delta_neutral ...` now produces real iron-condor backtest results.

### ENH-039: Per-strategy commission accounting
Spec: v2 doc §8.
Today: commissions flow through `trade_closes` but aren't attributed back to a strategy in reporting. Nice-to-have for strategy-ranking analytics.

### ENH-040: Trades-tab strategy provenance polish ✅ PARTIAL (strategy filter shipped)
Status: **Strategy filter dropdown shipped** in commit `82848ae`. Populated from distinct strategy_name values in the loaded trade set. Works alongside existing Status / Ticker / Period filters.
Remaining: per-strategy P&L summary cards at top of Trades tab (total pnl, win-rate, trade count per strategy). Low priority — analytics page already has cross-strategy views.

### ENH-041: Retire main branch / make profitability-research the default ✅ PARTIAL
Status: **main fast-forwarded to trunk** 2026-04-22. `origin/main` and `origin/feature/profitability-research` now point at the same commit. Remaining step: user toggles GitHub repo default branch to `main` in Settings, then `feature/profitability-research` can be deleted. One-click on GitHub.

### ENH-043: Threads tab — strategy filter dropdown
Dashboard Threads view lists every scanner/entry-manager/exit-manager row for every strategy in one big table. With 4 strategies × ~15 tickers that's 60+ rows and it's hard to zero-in on problems for a specific strategy. Add a strategy filter (dropdown populated from distinct strategy_name, same pattern as ENH-040 Trades tab). Multi-select is a nice-to-have; single-select is enough for v1.

### ENH-044: Orphan bracket-order cleanup for closed trades
Observed today (2026-04-23): IB shows multiple AAPL/MSFT bracket orders in "Transmit" status with no corresponding open DB trade. Some carry a strategy `orderRef`, others are ref-less (legacy). Causes: (a) previous `_atomic_close` cancelled the position but the bracket children were left working; (b) reconciliation's `bracket_restored` path creates fresh brackets but doesn't clean up the prior bracket orphans; (c) orders placed pre-ref-tagging era have no way to attribute. Work:
1. On trade close, cancel every working order whose `orderRef` matches the closed trade's `client_trade_id`, not just the two stored bracket ids.
2. Periodic sweep: working SELL/STP orders with no matching open trade AND no matching closed-within-60s trade → cancel them.
3. Ref-less orphans surfaced in the dashboard as a cleanup queue the user can one-click cancel.

### ENH-045: Ref-less order backfill
Related to ENH-044. Orders placed before `orderRef` stamping shipped have no provenance in IB. Either (a) stamp-retroactively via `modifyOrder` when reconciliation discovers them (only works for still-working orders), or (b) document them as legacy and rely on the cleanup sweep in ENH-044.

### ENH-046: Submit multi-leg entries as BAG/combo orders (single order, single bracket)
Today `place_multi_leg_order` submits N independent `MarketOrder`s — 4 separate orders in TWS for an iron condor. Problems observed 2026-04-23:
- Partial-fill risk on entry (solved at entry-level via the OCA fix, but still fragile)
- N separate SL brackets = N separate random-fire risks
- Per-leg SL on a short wing of an iron condor is semantically wrong — max loss for an iron condor is `wing_width × contracts × multiplier − net_credit`, not a per-leg stop
- TWS shows 4 unrelated orders instead of one strategy

Proposed fix: use IB's **BAG** (combo) contract with `comboLegs`, submit as one net-credit/net-debit order:
```python
bag = Contract(secType="BAG", symbol=underlying, currency="USD", exchange="SMART")
bag.comboLegs = [
    ComboLeg(conId=short_call.conId, ratio=1, action="SELL", exchange="SMART"),
    ComboLeg(conId=long_call.conId,  ratio=1, action="BUY",  exchange="SMART"),
    ComboLeg(conId=short_put.conId,  ratio=1, action="SELL", exchange="SMART"),
    ComboLeg(conId=long_put.conId,   ratio=1, action="BUY",  exchange="SMART"),
]
order = LimitOrder("BUY", qty, limit_price=net_debit_or_credit)
```
Benefits:
- One order in TWS UI (expands to 4 legs)
- All-or-nothing fill (no partial condor)
- One bracket (TP on net price, SL on net price) — proper iron-condor risk accounting
- Cleaner `trades` envelope ↔ IB order mapping (1:1)

Work:
1. Build bag contract in `broker/ib_orders.py` — new `place_combo_order(legs, net_price, tp_net, sl_net)` method.
2. Update `TradeEntryManager._enter_multi_leg` to route here when the strategy declares it's a defined-risk spread.
3. Update `trade_legs` persistence — store the combo conId, individual leg conIds, but only one bracket per envelope.
4. Update `strategy/exit_executor.py` multi-leg close path to also use the BAG (buy-to-close at net price).
5. Backtest: `backtest_engine/multi_leg_sim.py` already evaluates on net premium — matches the combo semantics, no change needed.

### ENH-047: Trades page — per-leg drill-down for multi-leg trades
`dashboard/frontend/src/components/TradeTable.tsx` renders every trade as one row. Multi-leg trades (n_legs > 1) should render with an expand caret that reveals each leg row (symbol, direction, strike, right, contracts, entry/exit fill, per-leg P&L). Ask the API to surface `/api/trades/{id}/legs` (new endpoint reading from `trade_legs`) so the table can lazy-load the legs on expand.

## HIGH — Important for Reliable Operation

### ENH-001: IB Streaming Market Data
Replace snapshot polling with streaming subscriptions for sub-second price updates.
Spec: `docs/production_improvements.md`
Status: Not started

### ENH-024: Strategy Plugin Framework — Multi-Scanner Architecture
Spec: `docs/strategy_plugin_framework.md` + `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` Phase 4.
Status: **In Progress.** Partially shipped:
- DB `strategies` table + seed rows, `BaseStrategy` abstract class, `LegSpec`/`Signal` dataclasses — **shipped** (commit `98cf1b4`).
- Backtest engine routes through strategy plugins (`backtest_engine/` uses strategy_id) — **shipped**.
- ORB + VWAP plugins implemented end-to-end against backtest — **shipped** (commits `95133b1`, `7a60228`).
- **LIVE SCANNER DOES NOT YET DISPATCH THROUGH PLUGINS** — still hardcoded to `SignalEngine` at `strategy/scanner.py:96`.

Completion plan: `docs/multi_strategy_architecture_v2.md` Phase 4 replaces the hardcoded `SignalEngine` import with a `StrategyRegistry.get(strategy_id)` lookup in scanner setup.

### ENH-023: Futures Options Support (MNQ, NQ, ES, MES, GC, CL)
Spec: `docs/futures_options_support.md`, `docs/futures_options_implementation.md`, `docs/fop_live_trading_design.md`.
Status: **In Progress.** Partially shipped:
- Backtest FOP works (commit `0dfddde` — sweep FOP support, MES/MNQ-friendly defaults) — **shipped**.
- `FOP_SPECS` registered, contract handling for CME/FOP fixed (commit `ff618d2`) — **shipped**.
- Backtest cache pyarrow + pickle fallback (commit `5d90c6a`) — **shipped**.
- Probe tools under `tools/` — **shipped**.
- **Live trading not yet wired** — `fop_live_trading_design.md` is the plan.

### ENH-007: Option Rolling Logic
Spec: `docs/close_flow_fixes_2026_04_21.md` (same-strike guard + roll-loop fix).
Status: **Shipped.** Close step uses `execute_exit()` (BUG-035). Same-strike guard prevents roll-loop churn (commit `a1f23df`). Stale-cache false-positive in POST-SELL bracket verify fixed (commit `949c7da`). Roll trigger threshold config in settings table (BUG-043).

### ENH-008: TP to Trailing Stop
At 100% TP, move SL to TP level instead of hard exit.
Status: **Shipped** (`strategy/exit_conditions.py::check_tp_to_trail`) — awaiting live validation.

duplication — server does all computation, app is a thin client for monitoring,
control, and alerts. Push notifications for trade events.
Spec: `docs/ios_mobile_app.md`
Status: Design documented, not started.

### ENH-026: Delta-Neutral Strategy (Iron Condor / Iron Butterfly)
Theta decay strategy for range-bound markets. 0DTE iron condors on SPY/QQQ.
Requires multi-leg combo order support. Complements directional strategies.
Spec: `docs/delta_neutral_strategy.md`
Status: **Blocked on ENH-031 (multi-leg support).** Research complete, design documented.

### ENH-022: Code Profiling & Performance Monitoring
cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler integration. Performance monitoring
endpoint. Optimization areas identified: DB cache, IB streaming, exit evaluation.
Spec: `docs/testing_framework.md` (profiling section)
Status: Design documented, not started.

| BUG-036 | MSFT option contract qualification fails (code 200) | Chain strikes don't exist for 0DTE | Try ATM + 6 nearest candidate strikes | Fixed |
| BUG-037 | Reconciliation not syncing DB with IB | Pass 1 only checked memory; symbol matching fragile | Two-pass rewrite using conId matching | Fixed |
| BUG-038 | QQQ 634 Call closed 3x after rolling | Double-call between execute_exit + execute_roll | Split logic: rolling calls execute_roll only | Fixed |
| BUG-039 | No position check before sell orders | Raw SELL without checking position | `get_ib_position_qty()` before every sell; `max_qty` param | Fixed |
| BUG-040 | Option symbol shows raw OCC with spaces | IB returns `"GOOGL 260415P00332500"` | Strip spaces before regex; added Call/Put label | Fixed |

### Regression fixes (REG-001 through REG-006)

| Reg | Description | Root Cause | Fix | Status |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----|--------|
| REG-001 | IB event loop blocked by DB writes | `_on_ib_error` did DB writes on IB thread | Log-only on IB thread | Fixed |
| REG-002 | 6x IB calls per contract lookup | SPY multi-exchange loop in hot path | Try SMART first, fall back individually | Fixed |
| REG-003 | Timeout recovery completely broken | `ThreadPoolExecutor` closed too early | Keep executor alive during 35s window | Fixed |
| REG-004 | Exit manager heartbeat too frequent | DB write every 5s | Every 30s (6 cycles) | Fixed |
| REG-005 | Stale bot state after crash | DB showed `status='running'` after crash | Manual cleanup; sidecar required | Fixed (manual) |
| REG-006 | IB pool connections all timing out | `ib_async` event loop thread affinity | `connect()` + event loop on same dedicated thread | Fixed |

### Lessons Learned from Regressions

> **REG-001 through REG-005 were all introduced in the same session (2026-04-14/15).** Root causes:
>
> 1. **Calling blocking code on the IB event loop thread** — The IB error callback MUST be non-blocking.
> 2. **Refactoring scope too large without incremental testing.**
> 3. **Loop amplification** — Adding a 6-exchange loop to a hot-path function.
> 4. **No integration test after multi-file changes.**

### Enhancements (ENH-002 through ENH-015)
- **ENH-002**: Heartbeat monitoring — exit manager (30s), bot main (30s), scanner (60s) heartbeats to thread_status
- **ENH-003**: Error pipeline — connected `log_error()` to populate errors table
- **ENH-004**: System status — stale/dead detection in ThreadsTab, system log viewer panel
- **ENH-005**: Analytics v2 — 3 new charts, 2 new SQL views, drilldown support
- **ENH-006**: Separate signal engine from trade management
- **ENH-009**: SPY option chain fix — prefer 0DTE chain, multi-exchange qualification
- **ENH-014**: Button loading states — Start/Stop Bot and Scans show pulse while in progress
- **ENH-015**: Trade count summary badges — total/open/closed/errored counts

### Infrastructure
- Database schema (14 tables + analytics views + system_log + trade_closes + trade_commands + test_runs/results)
- Bot DB integration (dual-write)
- FastAPI backend
- React frontend (Trades, Analytics, Threads, Tickers, Settings, Backtest, Tests tabs)
- Docker Compose deployment (PostgreSQL, API, Frontend, pgAdmin)
- Bot manager sidecar (port 9000)
- IB trade ID integration (permId, conId, client_trade_id)
- DB-based state management (replaced file-based)
- Batch IB pricing
- Centralized error handler (handle_error + safe_call)
- IB errorEvent handler (non-blocking, log-only)
- IB connection pool (4 slots: exit-mgr + scanner A/B/C) with thread-affine event loops
